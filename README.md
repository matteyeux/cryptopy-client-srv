# cryptopy-client-srv
school project we made in an hour and with few improvments when at home <br>
simple poc don't use in production :P <br>

# usage 
### Server
First, start server, it will listen on port `2345`

```
./client.py
usage: ./client.py [message] <key>
```

Make sure you are in the client directory or you'll get an error like that :
```
./client/client.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./client/client.py", line 8, in <module>
    import cesar
ImportError: No module named 'cesar'
```
